# Cotation Calculation System

## Overview
The **Cotation Calculation System** is a full-stack web application designed for dynamic cotation calculations. It allows businesses to efficiently calculate cotation values, manage data, and deliver accurate results to users. This system consists of two major components:

- **Backend**: Handles server-side logic, data processing, and database interactions.
- **Frontend**: Provides a user-friendly interface built with React for seamless interaction with the system.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

### Backend:
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for executing server-side logic.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for building RESTful APIs.
- **MongoDB** (or other databases): Stores cotation data.

### Frontend:
- **React.js**: JavaScript library for building interactive UIs.
- **HTML5/CSS3**: Basic web technologies for structuring and styling the pages.
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic content and user interactions.
- **Axios**: HTTP client for making API requests between frontend and backend.

### Tools & Utilities:
- **npm**: Node package manager for managing dependencies and running scripts.

## ⚙️ Project Setup

### Prerequisites
Before starting the setup process, ensure that the following are installed:
- **Node.js** (latest LTS version recommended)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)

### Installation Instructions
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd cotation-calculation-main
   ```

2. **Install Backend Dependencies:**
   - Navigate to the **backend** directory:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     ```
   - Install the backend dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - Set up environment variables (e.g., MongoDB URI) in a `.env` file.

3. **Install Frontend Dependencies:**
   - Navigate to the **frontend** directory:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     ```
   - Install the frontend dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the Backend**:
   - Navigate to the backend folder and run:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     npm start
     ```
   - The backend server should be available at `http://localhost:<PORT>` (check console logs for the exact port).

2. **Start the Frontend**:
   - Open a new terminal window, navigate to the frontend folder, and run:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     npm start
     ```
   - The frontend will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.
